                <h1>Help Support The Berry Bucks!</h1>
                
                <p>Hey Bucks fans, hope y’all are doing well!</p>

                <p>
                    With the spring season approaching, the Bucks are excited to share that we have some great tournament opportunities this spring, shaping up to be the most competitive regular season in Berry Bucks history. We are planning on attending Richmond’s D-III River City Showdown, D-III Easterns, and Florida Warmup — one of the elite D-I tournaments that draws a plethora of D-I nationals-level teams!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are blessed with these opportunities and are going to these tournaments with the aim of challenging ourselves in the regular season to not only win regionals, but to push our ceiling at Nationals in May. With that, we are asking for y’all to consider financially supporting us this season to help cover costs of lodging, travel, and bid fees. Whatever you are able to give will be received with much gratitude and go a long way toward helping our team continue to be one of the best D-III teams in the country!
                </p>

                <p>With gratitude,<br>
                <strong>Bucks Leadership</strong></p>
