                <h1>Help Send The Berry Bucks To Nationals!</h1>
                <h2>Dear Family and Friends,</h2>
                <p>
                    We have some exciting news to share — the <strong>Berry Bucks Ultimate Frisbee</strong> team has just won Regionals and officially qualified for <strong>USA Ultimate D-III Nationals</strong> in Burlington, Washington! This is a huge accomplishment for our team, and we couldn’t be more proud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we’re working hard to make the next step possible: <em>getting our team to Nationals</em>. We’re asking for your support to help us make the trip across the country and give every player the opportunity to represent Berry College on the national stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimate Frisbee has brought us together as a family. We've grown through many practices, long road trips, and countless hours building our chemistry both on and off the field. Competing at Nationals is a dream come true — and we want every single one of our teammates to share in this experience, regardless of financial barriers.
                </p>
                <p>Your donation will go directly toward:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Travel expenses (flights, gas, van rentals)</li>
    <li>Lodging during the tournament weekend</li>
    <li>Tournament entry fees</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Every dollar helps! Your generosity brings us one step closer to this unforgettable opportunity!
</p>

<p>
    To our amazing family, friends, and former teammates — thank you for continuing to support our passion and for joining us on this adventure! We’d be so grateful if you considered supporting our journey to Nationals.
</p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for believing in us!
                </p>

                    With gratitude,<br>
